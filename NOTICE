This project was originally developed by Kaleido in 2023 and then modified by Daniel Almendra in 2024.

The main feature implemented in this fork is the possibility to execute DvP Transactions to exchange an ERC-20 for an ERC-1155 token (or vice-versa) using Anonymous Zether.

Key modifications:
- Modified main script (app.js):
	- Now, ERC-1155 tokens are supported in the authorize and mint functions.
- Modified lib/trade-manager/cash-token.js to add ERC-1155 token support
- New ABIs for the token and Anonymous Zether smart contracts: the lib/abi directory now includes the actual JSON files referring to the complete ABIs for the token and Anonymous Zether smart contracts.
- To support the above change, the script lib/base.js had to be adjusted to fetch the whole ABI and filter the ABI section within it.
